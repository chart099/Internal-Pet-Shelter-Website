## Description
With the goal of making a centralized location for employees of pet shelters to manage the availability of pets for adoption, we created an Internal Pet Adoption Website. 

This website can easily be customized to accommodate a shelter with multiple locations or a group of affiliated shelters. This website can also easily be customized to accommodate different animal types.
Future development would include integrating a customer facing aspect to help get more pets in needs to forever homes.

## Usage
This site is not designed to be a customer facing site but rather a resource for employees of a shelter, or group of affiliated shelters, to check on how many pets and the availability of those pets for adoption. Upon opening the site, the user will be prompted to login. After login, all the shelter locations (or all shelters within an affiliated group) will be displayed. The user can select and individual shelter by clicking. A page displaying all the pets current housed at that location will be displayed. Additionally, on this page, a newly arrived pet can be added to the roster. By clicking on the individual pet, a brief bio will be displayed. Additionally, on this page, once a pet had been placed in a forever home, that pet can be deleted from the database.
